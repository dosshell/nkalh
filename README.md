Script for downloading fun stuff from ARPANET!

What it is
----------
It is a script for easy and hassle free automated downloading of the fun stuff you are watching at the ARPANET.

What it isn't
-------------
Your mum. Really it's not your mum. It can't do the food the way you like it nor can it download the object in your specific needs. What you get is what you get and you get it easy.

Usage
